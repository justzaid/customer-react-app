## Project Description

Airque is a customer service platform that efficiently manages customer tickets. These tickets are raised by users to address concerns related to their experiences with the airline's services.

The platform consists of a ticket managing system built with React for the frontend and Express for the backend using an API. It allows registered users to create, view, update and delete support tickets while also send reviews as responses based on support agent feedbacks. Administrators or support agents have additional privileges to manage tickets and users.
